chromacloud
===========

A chrome extension for [CloudApp](http://getcloudapp.com/).

This is an extension to easily send links to CloudApp and put the url on your clipboard.

No information is sent to the creator of this extension, all communication happens directly with CloudApp. You need a CloudApp account before using this extension. 

Currently there is no error checking or handling for missing or invalid credentials. I hope to fix this as well as add file upload into a future version. 

Your mileage may vary and I do not claim any responsibility for using this extension. Use at your own risk.

I am in no way affiliated with CloudApp, I simply used their [API](https://github.com/cloudapp/api/)

NOTE:
There is an installable .crx in this repo. It is to be considered the beta version. It may have features that are not in the Chrome Webstore version of [chromacloud](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromacloud/jdpfockeefnnnkdajngibkacghcbabfe).
Additionally, if you install the extension from this repo, it will auto-update from this repo.
[Contact](https://github.com/michaelorr/chromacloud/issues) me if you want to change this behavior.
